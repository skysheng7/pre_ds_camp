# 🔮 Posit Cloud Setup Guide

Posit Cloud is our magical online coding environment where you'll write R code in your web browser - no installation needed! It's free, professional, easy to share with others, and has everything pre-installed for our data science adventures.

## 📋 Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create Your Account

1. 🌐 Go to [posit.cloud](https://posit.cloud)
2. 🖱️ Click **"Get Started"** if you don't have an account, or **"Sign Up"** if you already have an account
3. 🆓 You will see the "Free" plan on the left most column, click **"Learn more"**
4. ✍️ Click **"Sign up"**
5. 📧 Enter your email address and create a password; Or sign up using your own Google account, GitHub account or Clever account
6. ✅ Verify your email (check your email's inbox for an email from Posit Cloud, and click "verify email"!)
7. 🎯 Go back to your Posit Cloud page and click **"Continue"**


### Step 2: Join Our Camp Workspace

Here is the workspace link we will use during this camp. It's called "data_playground". You can copy the link directly by hovering your mouse over the top right corner of the text box below:
```
https://posit.cloud/spaces/624374/join?access_code=DPo4bWWzbmekRHTREK_nW0M8Sjmpjmjd3gXKHLFO`
```

If the above link is too long for you, try this shorter one:
```
https://shorturl.at/iM1Hk
```

1. 🔗 Click the workspace link from your instructor
2. 🎯 Click **"Join Workspace"**
3. ✨ You're in! You will see **"data_playground"** being listed on the left panel. If you click on "All Content", you should see project for **"Day_1"**.

### Step 3: Test Your Setup

1. 📂 Open the **"Day_1"** project
   
   💡 **Important**: When you open this project, Posit Cloud automatically creates your own permanent copy! This means you can make changes, play around, and save your work - it's all yours to keep and access later.

2. 🖱️ Under the **"Console"** tab (top left)
3. ⌨️ Type: 
```
print("Hello, magical data world!")
```

Feel free to print out anything else you would like to try!

4. ⏎ Press Enter

5. 🎉 You should see your message appear!

- ✅ Ask a friend or instructor for help

#### "Everything is slow!"

- ✅ Make sure you have good internet connection

## 🎉 You're Ready for Magic!
