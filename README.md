# 🌟 Data Science for Kids Summer Camp

> *A magical 5-day journey into the world of data science for young explorers aged 10-14*

Welcome to an enchanting adventure where mathematics meets magic, and data tells stories! This summer camp introduces fundamental data science concepts through hands-on activities, storytelling, and creative projects using R programming.

## Note
This is a wrapper repository to store the material before camp, because I wish to send the page to parents to set up accounts before camp begin. 

## ✨ What Makes This Camp Special?

- 🎯 **Learning through play**: Toys, games, and creative projects make abstract concepts concrete
- 🤝 **Peer collaboration**: Pair programming and team challenges build friendships and skills
- 📚 **Story-driven learning**: Every concept is wrapped in magical, engaging narratives
- 📈 **Incremental complexity**: From simple variables to neural networks, step by step
- 🎨 **Visual and hands-on**: Physical activities combined with beautiful digital programming
